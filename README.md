BlubberPatrol is a practice app that I wrote to learn Salesforce Apex &amp; Visualforce. It consists of one custom object to record the user's weight each day. Then it will draw charts to show trends of various durations. The user can choose between the original Google Chart API, and the newer Google Visualization API to draw the charts.
