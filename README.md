BlubberPatrol is a practice app that I wrote to learn Salesforce Apex &amp; Visualforce. It records the user's weight each day, and then draws charts to show trends of various durations. The user can choose between the original Google Chart API, and the newer Google Visualization API to draw the charts. At the time of this writing, the app was about 900 lines of code, of which 680 were Apex, 100 were Visualforce, 40 were CSS, and 100 were test methods. (Note: I also have an Android version of this app in the Google Play Store that I wrote in Java.)

When I began this project, I used the Salesforce Developer Console. Then I graduated to using MavensMate with Sublime Text 3, and SourceTree to upload my files to GitHub.
