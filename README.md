BlubberPatrol is a practice app that I wrote to learn Salesforce Apex &amp; Visualforce. It records the user's weight each day, and then draws charts to show trends of various durations. The user can choose between the original Google Chart API, and the newer Google Visualization API to draw the charts. At the time of this writing, the app is about 900 lines of code, of which 680 are Apex, 100 are Visualforce, 40 are CSS, and 100 are test methods. (Note: I also have an Android version of this app in the Google Play Store that I wrote in Java.)

When I began this project, I used the Salesforce Developer Console, which is a pretty good tool. However, for some reason it was <i>extremely</i> slow to scroll through log files. So, I switched to Sublime Text 3 with the MavensMate plugin. And that also allowed me to put my files into version control with SourceTree and upload them to GitHub.
